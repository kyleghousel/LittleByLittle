# User Stories for LittleByLittle

### 1. Set up database migrations
As a developer, I want to define migrations so that I can create a structured relational database to store children, milestones, and entries.

### 2. Seed the database
As a developer, I want to populate the database with sample children, milestones, and entries so that I can test and interact with the CLI while building.

### 3. Create RESTful API routes (Sinatra backend)
As a CLI user, I want to fetch and modify data through well-structured endpoints so that I can interact with the journal via the command line.

### 4. Create a new child
As a user, I want to add a new child with their name and birthdate so that I can track milestones and memories specific to that child.

As a user, I want to see a list of all children in the journal so that I can select which child to manage.

As a user, I want to create a new milestone category so that I can track meaningful events not already listed.

### 8. Create a new entry for a child
As a user, I want to create an entry for a selected child, choosing from the list of milestone categories, so that I can preserve a specific moment in their development.
